# Flight Management System

Report
[So, yeah, our product does stuff with things.] An overview of a semi-automated seaplane airline client and customer reimbursement system. 

Heading
[We did this.]
It lowers waiting times due to inefficient scheduling by informing passengers of their schedules and the overall schedules. Male' people are high priority. Flight may not be consistent so passengers would fly, land on a spot, and fly from there. The dashboard contains….. Passengers have access to a user interface. Passengers drag and drop themselves to their seat in their flight from the interface.

Heading 2
[We did this too.]
Heading 2+
[And we did this too.]

Aims and Objectives
[Things we want to happen.]
To make a functioning airline system where passengers won't have long waiting durations from being informed of their schedules days ahead.

Literature Review
[Two wise bicycle repairmen once said.....] i.e. Wright Brother's joke, also insert literature review here for...whatever we'd need it.

Project Planning and Team Roles
[We do stuff.]

We make friendly, not awkward discussions delegating project tasks to whoever leaves their hands free. Someone's the scrum master. Mahul manages mockups of flight tracking. La'aly and me write the cumulative report. We made a use case diagram to help with scheduling.

Requirements
[I mean....it has to work.]
Our project has to keep up with external source changes. Passwords are ensured not to be leaked to unreliable forces. Serverside vulnerabilities and cybersecurity is to be maintained. Upgrades would come at a hefty cost. Making algorithms would require a lengthy amount of time.

Design and Test Plan
We made a UML diagram where our client, the airline, is able to add and remove passengers and warn if flights are overbooked or overweight. The airline is also able to publish their schedule to passengers as well as the operators who cater the flight. 
So basically, functions that deal with weight distribution and passenger assigning. And after that, there's GPS and the time distance calculator to deal with.
Resorts would have access to the webpage. Adult, kid, infant weight classes. If slots are filled, remove passengers.
Software System (UI?) Title: FMS (TMA?)…Airlines, whose main objective is to schedule flights.
Scheduling data is fancily implemented into a database.
In the front end, there's two things, a booking request page, and a scheduling publishing page.
And a login page in there somewhere.
Interface shows "wallpaper" of different islands.
Press button to print flight details.
The system takes bookings…?
Create a heavily coded algorithm.
The bot knows TMA's resort travelling timelines.
List of people who travel come with timeframe they need to.
After pressing register, register window appears.
Copyright and additional information on bottom of screen.
TMA can suspend or delete or retract resort accounts accordingly.
TMA has two staff accounts: reservation and ticketing, and the manager/super administrator.
Running on basically an automated-scheduling algorithm/system, catering list of passengers.
Flight reservations for flights of special cases.
Algorithm is given list of passengers.
User gives TMA list of passengers.
Two functions included: list sorting and flight tracking.
End product is information excel sheet of airline-assigned flight details for resorts. Yep, you can't even choose your seats.
(though still deciding if details are assigned or already chosen by passengers.)

Implementation Testing
[We're proud to state that our second plane successfully didn't crash.] i.e. insert whatever info falls into "implementation testing"

Conclusion
[Have mercy on our performance, we did our best.]
